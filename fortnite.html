      <h2 class="fortnite">Fortnite?</h2>
      <p class="fortnite">Fortnite is a battle royale video game released by Epic Games in 2017. The main idea of a battle royale game is that you are placed in a game (usually made up of 100 players) and you fight until there is one victor. What sets Fortnite apart, however, is that it does not attempt to be realistic. This can be seen in both the game's graphics and mechanics. For example, the recoil system used for spray weapons in Fortnite is based on random bloom, as opposed to the more popular spray pattern.</p>

      <h2 class="fortnite">Storm Mechanic</h2>
      <p class="fortnite">As the game progresses, the storm forms and pushes players into a shrinking area, with a damage penalty to players in the storm. This increased proximity encourages fighting.</p>

        <p class="center fortnite">Widely considered as a "jack of all trades," the AR is most effective at medium range combat. ARs are almost always "hitscan" meaning that there are no ballistic physics. If a target is on the crosshair when a bullet is fired, the target will take damage. While automatic ARs have bloom when spraying, most have first-bullet-accuracy, which makes it so that the first bullet fired in a spray does not have bloom.</p>

        <p class="center fortnite">SMGs are the only fully automatic gun in Fortnite. They are most effective at close range due to their very high bloom when spraying.</p>

        <p class="center fortnite">Sniper rifles are the only gun in Fortnite that have bullet drop. They are most effective at long range, and are the only gun that can eliminate a player with a single headshot.</p>
